I'm awful with watching movies due to my internet induced short attention span. This page is going over movies I've been watching.

* 2001 A Space Odyssey
Enjoyed it but needed some additonal help from Reddit to fully analyze the story.
* No Country For Old Men
The ending is a change of pace from most movies that have a clearer conflict/resolution style ending.
* Taxi Driver
Not my favorite but interesting enough to watch the entire thing.
* Get Out
Wow it was good.
