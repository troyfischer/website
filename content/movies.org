Movies I'm watching...

* Avatar 2
Avatars live in a lovely communist utopia
* 2001 A Space Odyssey
Enjoyed it but needed some additonal help from Reddit to fully analyze the story.
* No Country For Old Men
The ending is a change of pace from most movies that have a clearer conflict/resolution style ending.
* Taxi Driver
Not my favorite but interesting enough to watch the entire thing.
* Get Out
Wow it was good.
* Ex Machina
* Whiplash
Drum solos
* Parasite
Cool movie about the struggle of working class people while the wealthy are completely oblivious.
