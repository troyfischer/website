Keeping track of the books I've read recently.

* I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings
Did not know this was an autobiography prior to picking it up.
* Player Piano
Currently my favorite Vonnegut book.
* Loveless
Interesting but I gave up on it 3/4 of the way through.
* Hamnet
Not to say it wasn't good but difficult to read much of it before bed because it put me to sleep quite quickly.
* Animal Farm
Easy but good read.
* God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater
On and off with this one which has made it difficult for me to follow. Not sure I'll finish it.
