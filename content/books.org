* A Supposedly Fun Thing I'll Never Do Again
Collection of essays - the one I read the collection for was the cruise ship experience.
DFW is an incredible author. Paints the entire picture with words. Also witty and funny.
* I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings
Did not know this was an autobiography prior to picking it up. Always
interesting to learn about the lives of others who've had things objectively far
more difficult than I have.

I was at a restaurant in the Florida Keys where there was a caged bird chirping
and remembered there was a book with that name and decided to read it.
* Player Piano
Currently my favorite Vonnegut book.

I loved the ending when the people start repairing the machines that the main
characters worked so hard to destroy. The idea that there's a level of
inevitablility to certain outcomes makes life easier to digest.
* Loveless
About a girl discovering she's asexual at university.

Interesting but a bit repetitive/dry about 3/4 of the way through. Could be due to the fact that I don't really relate but I didn't finish the book.
* Hamnet
A story about Shakespeare's son Hamnet. Enjoyed it but it took a while to finish due to how fast it put me to sleep before bed.
* Animal Farm
Easy but good read.

I find that a lot of right wingers (in the areas of the internet that I
frequent) liken Orwell's 1984 to todays society as a means to scare readers but
I wonder how many of those readers know Orwell described himself as a democratic
socialist.

* The Three Body Problem (Series)
I loved these books. I could not put them down and that is not something that
happens often for me.
** The Three Body Problem
** The Dark Forest
** Death's End
* Sirens Of Titan
Second favorite Vonnegut book.

Another fun idea that all of humanity is more or less a joke or a tool of some
far more advanced civilization.

I have added the word Trafalmadore to at least one code base that I've worked on.
* Cat's Cradle
I read all of it on a plane ride and genuinely do not remember a word.
* 1984
Easy classic.
* The Catcher in the Rye
One of those books I never had to read in school
* Children of Time
* The God Delusion
I think it's trendy to rag on the internet atheists (Sam Harris, Richard
Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, etc) of the early/mid 2010s but they undoubtedly
had a major impact on my life coming from parents that are
religious fundamentalists.
* Brave New World
* Farenheit 451
Another book I think most kids read in highscool but I somehow avoided.
* Chaos Monkeys
* Consider the Lobster
