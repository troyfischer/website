Books I've read ðŸ“š

* I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings
Did not know this was an autobiography prior to picking it up. Always
interesting to learn about the lives of others who've had things objectively far
more difficult than I have.

I was at a restaurant in the Florida Keys where there was a caged bird chirping
and remembered there was a book with that name and decided to read it.
* Player Piano
Currently my favorite Vonnegut book.

I loved the ending when the people start repairing the machines that the main
characters worked so hard to destroy. The idea that there's a level of
inevitablility to certain outcomes makes life easier to digest.
* Loveless
About a girl discovering she's asexual at university.

Interesting but a bit repetitive/dry about 3/4 of the way through. Could be due to the fact that I don't really relate but I didn't finish the book.
* Hamnet
A story about Shakespeare's son Hamnet. Enjoyed it but it took a while to finish due to how fast it put me to sleep before bed.
* Animal Farm
Easy but good read.

I find that a lot of right wingers (in the areas of the internet that I
frequent) liken Orwell's 1984 to todays society as a means to scare readers but
I wonder how many of those readers know Orwell described himself as a democratic
socialist.
