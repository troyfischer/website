Problem: [[https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/][Valid Anagram]]

* Thoughts
Multiple ways to do this one. The fastest should be =O(n)= time and =O(n)= space.

Use a hash map to count the appearances of each item and if they're the same by the end then they're anagrams.

#+begin_src python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        from collections import Counter

        c1 = Counter(s)
        c2 = Counter(t)

        return c1 == c2
#+end_src
