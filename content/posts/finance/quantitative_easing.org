* What is Quantitative Easing?
Most, especially in the realm of main stream finance, consider quantitative easing to be "money printing". This simply isn't true.

If QE caused money to be created in the real economy we would expect interest rates to rise.

The first QE was announced in November 2008. Let's see what happened to interest rates
