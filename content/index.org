** About Me
Lifestyle influencer cosplaying as a software engineer.

I attended the University of Florida and received my B.S. in Computer Science
in 2019. In 2024 I gave up on a CS masters program so I can now also claim the
title of *#college-dropout*. I currently work for [[https://www.capitalone.com/][Capital One]] but could be working
for you ðŸ˜‰.
